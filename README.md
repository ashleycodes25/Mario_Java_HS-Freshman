# Mario_Java_HS-Freshman

This program was assigned my freshman year of high school during our Java Game Development unit. <br/>
The attatched Mario.gfar file contains the playable Mario game I submitted for this program, the code, as well as sprites and background images I designed. <br/>
The file must be opened via Greenfoot, a free game development IDE developed by Kings College London.

**Insutructions:**
- Create a working 3-level Mario game based off of the original Super Mario Bros.
- Re-texture all the sprites to a theme of your choice via graphic design apps.

**Key Take Aways:**
- Learned how to manage my time in order to get a large, multi-week solo project done by the deadline.
- Learned how to debug a program by myself and problem solve in order to make different parts of the program work.
- Learned how to create a scrolling background that moves with the player as they move.
- Learned how to re-texture sprites using pixel graphic design apps.
